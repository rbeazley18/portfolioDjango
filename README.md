My Coding Portfolio Website: robertbeazley.com

A website I created to display my coding projects. I built this site using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It has CRUD functionality and allows me to add new projects through the Django Admin page without having to update any code. This site runs on a Heroku dyno and stores photos/thumbnails in a AWS S3 bucket, and I also purchased a URL through NameCheap and setup the CNAME and Alias to redirect to the Heroku URL. I may eventually rebuild this project using React and Next.js for a more interactive and dynamic feel, but this site is working well as an easy way to display my portfolio projects.
