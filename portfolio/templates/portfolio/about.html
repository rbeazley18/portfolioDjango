                    <p class="lead text-left text-light">My name is Robert, and I am a software developer based out of Chapel Hill, NC. I am currently transitioning from a career in utility forestry to software development and spend most of my free time coding. I enjoy building projects to strengthen my skills in Python, Django, HTML, and CSS. I recently completed my first freelance project by creating a website for a family member's graphic design business. As I continue to learn, I hope to take on more complex projects and transition into software development full-time.
