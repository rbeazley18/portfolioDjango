                        <p class="lead text-left">&emsp;I grew up in Mooresville, NC and attended NC State University. After graduating with a degree in Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology, I moved out West and spent a few years working for ski resorts in Colorado and California. While in California, I began my role as a Consulting Utility Forester and worked with a utility in the Lake Tahoe region to maintain the reliability and safety of power lines by identifying hazard trees that could impact the lines. After a few years out West, I moved to Chapel Hill, NC and continued my career in utility forestry as a contractor for Duke Energy. Around October of 2021 I began seeking an entirely new career path and made it a goal to learn how to code so that I could work towards becoming a software developer. I had no idea what I was getting into at the time and have learned to appreciate the complexity of this field. Each day I work towards my goal of becoming a self-taught developer and continue to expand my knowledge and understanding of code and all of its applications in the real world. I appreciate you taking the time to learn more about me!
